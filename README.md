# rpi-umpx-decoder
This repository contains the MicroMPX set-up for [ZuidWest FM](https://www.zuidwestfm.nl/) in the Netherlands. It uses a Rapsberry 4 or 5 and a [HiFiBerry DAC2 Pro XLR
](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/boards/hifiberry-dac2-pro-xlr/) as audio output. It downloads the most recent version of the MicroMPX decoder from Thimeo, which is managed by systemd as service.

# How to prepare the Raspberry Pi
- Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite 12 (Bookworm)
- Ensure you are root by running `sudo su`
- Download and run the install script with the command `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oszuidwest/rpi-umpx-decoder/main/setup.sh)"`
- After a reboot MicroMPX should be running on `http://{{ip}}:8080`

## A few words about the Raspberry Pi 5
MicroMPX and HiFiBerry boards work well with the Raspberry Pi 5. There is currently [a bug](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/5743) in the firmware that requires you to edit the `/boot/firwmare/config.txt` manually. Add `,slave` after the `dtoverlay` for the HiFiBerry. For example `dtoverlay=hifiberry-dacplus,slave`.

# How to add the Raspberry Pi to the VPN
- Download and run the VPN script with the command `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oszuidwest/rpi-umpx-decoder/main/vpn.sh)"`
- Check with `ip a` if you have an interface named `wg0` with the correct IP
- If the `wg0` interface is not showing, enable debugging with `modprobe wireguard && echo module wireguard +p > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control` and `tail -f /var/log/syslog` to look for errors

## Optional heartbeat monitoring
You can optionally integrate heartbeat monitoring. In this case the Pi will `wget --spider` a given url every minute, acting as a heartbeat. This can be any url, but we tested with Uptime Robot. A paid account is required at Uptime Robot for heartbeat monitoring.
